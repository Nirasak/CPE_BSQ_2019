# CPE_BSQ_2019

## Description

You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.

The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument. The file is valid if it is respecting those
constraints:  
• its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),  
• “.” (representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for the
other lines,  
• all of the lines are of the same length (except the first one),  
• it contains at least one line,  
• each line is terminated by ‘\n’.

You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
